408,_02,57,_07,_01,_02,_03,_01,_02,,,,,,,,_02,"No, I’m not. The work environment has become hostile, which makes it difficult for people to feel ownership or pride in what they do. Open communication is discouraged, opinions are often dismissed, and if you don’t align with certain viewpoints, you’re talked down to or made to feel inadequate. That kind of culture kills motivation and collaboration. This unfortunately is only in North America, the rest of our company is not anything like this which is disheartening.

What makes this even more fulfilling is being part of an industry that has proven to be both essential and resilient, consistently withstanding economic fluctuations. The stability of the sector, combined with the opportunity to solve complex challenges and build lasting relationships, is what makes this career deeply rewarding for me."
417,_02,51,_07,_01,_Other,_03,_02,,,,,,,,,_03,"I have a very good job and I enjoy what I do, but it has been a hard fought battle.  It took me over 20 years to get to the Director level at my company, and I continue to strive to move further up.  I feel like I am constantly battling the good ole boy's network even today.  It is much, much better than it was when I first started in this industry, but I think it will take at least a generation before we have enough women in powerful positions who will be able to pull other women up with them."

However, navigating a male-dominated industry as a woman has presented its own set of struggles. While I’ve grown stronger and more resilient through these experiences, I believe there’s still work to be done in creating a more inclusive and supportive environment for everyone."

790,_02,29,_04,_02,_03,_06,_06,,,,,,,,,_02,"Anonymous hazard-reporting systems are poorly publicized, fostering fear of retaliation. Workers often prioritize speed over safety, dismissing minor risks (e.g., tripping hazards) that escalate into serious incidents due to cultural apathy."
791,_02,35,_04,_01,_01,_05,_04,,,,,,,,,_02,"Emergency plans are rarely updated beyond initial approvals, and drills (e.g., fire evacuations) occur infrequently. Many sites lack trained first responders, leading to prolonged recovery times and preventable injuries during crises."
793,_02,36,_04,_01,_01,_05,_05,,,,,,,,,_02,"Management frequently pressures crews to cut corners (e.g., skipping pre-task safety briefings) to meet deadlines. Safety performance metrics are decoupled from project incentives, creating a ""speed over safety"" mindset that erodes trust in safety protocols."
798,_02,30,_02,_01,_07,_06,_02,_03,,,,,,,,_03,"It's steady work with good benefits, but the overnight surveillance shifts are taking a toll on my sleep schedule. The pay could better reflect the risks we handle daily."
799,_02,54,_05,_01,_03,_05,_08,,,,,,,,,_03,"Very rewarding. Implementing zero-trust architectures for healthcare clients gives purpose, but compliance documentation is tedious. Leadership invests heavily in upskilling us on new cloud security tech."
800,_01,25,_03,_01,_03,_06,_03,_04,,,,,,,,_03,"Love the cutting-edge AI work! Our self-learning models stop threats in real-time, but explaining autonomous responses to clients requires patience. Stock options are a huge plus."
801,_01,30,_04,_01,_02,_04,_01,_02,_03,,,,,,,_02,"Solid 8/10. Building next-gen firewalls with our SOC4 chips is technically fulfilling. However, the hardware division faces supply chain delays that strain deadlines."
802,_02,26,_03,_01,_03,_07,_06,_08,,,,,,,,_02,Mission-critical satisfaction. Protecting nuclear plants and grids gives immense responsibility. The niche OT focus means fewer career growth options unless I relocate.
803,_02,44,_05,_01,_03,_05,_06,,,,,,,,,_03,"Mixed feelings. Pentesting smart devices is exciting, but clients often ignore vulnerabilities we flag due to cost concerns. The startup culture is energetic yet unstable."
804,_02,49,_05,_01,_02,_04,_03,_04,,,,,,,,_03,"Proud but pressured. Developing rescue drones for national projects is honorable, yet 60-hour weeks during product launches are brutal. The IPO brought great equity rewards though."
808,_01,51,_05,_01,_02,_04,_04,_06,,,,,,,,_04,"Safety work is directly related to the safety and stability of individuals, enterprises, and even society. Whether in the fields of data security, network security, or physical security, the success of each risk warning and the repair of each vulnerability can effectively avoid potential losses. This sense of value of ""guardianship"" gives people a strong sense of professional identity."
809,_02,45,_07,_01,_05,_01,_01,_04,_08,,,,,,,_04,"The security industry has endowed me with three core values: 
1. Strategic implementation: By leveraging the functions of executive leadership and project management, the security strategy is integrated into the entire process of construction projects to avoid risks, safeguard safety, and gain a sense of value and motivation.
2. Resource Collaboration: By leveraging administrative management functions, integrate human and IT resources, build teams, introduce systems, efficiently solve security issues, and enhance work recognition.
3. Industry Impact: Participated in standard discussions and shared experiences as a C-level executive, promoting the industry's emphasis on safety. Highly satisfied with the work due to a sense of mission and willing to continue to delve deeper."
810,_02,40,_05,_01,_03,_07,_08,,,,,,,,,_03,"Thrilled to pioneer data governance in China. Working on national standards like 'Shuyou Space' is career-defining, but government audits demand perfectionism."
813,_02,33,_05,_01,_06,_01,_04,_08,,,,,,,,_02,"Due to the hidden barriers in the industry: when implementing the leadership's security strategy, there is often a gender stereotype of ""valuing experience over innovation"", which leads to significant resistance in the advancement of the plan. In project management, security resources are inclined towards male-dominated business, and security cooperation projects led by women are difficult to receive equal support. At the administrative management level, the industry's safety training and promotion channels are not well-suited for women, and their career development is restricted. We hope that the industry can break through prejudice and truly empower women on an equal footing."
814,_01,25,_03,_01,_01,_06,_06,,,,,,,,,_04,"Pretty satisfied, honestly. This job isn't as boring as sitting in an office; there's something new every day. Being able to help people avoid trouble feels pretty good, really energizing."
815,_01,29,_02,_01,_06,_05,_06,,,,,,,,,_04,"Satisfied? You bet. This job has weight, matters when it counts. Seeing everyone safe and sound makes what I do feel worthwhile."
816,_01,28,_04,_01,_04,_06,_06,,,,,,,,,_04,"Love this job! It gets crazy busy sometimes, but nailing a hidden risk each time gives such a sense of achievement. Colleagues are all solid, working together is awesome."
817,_02,24,_03,_01,_02,_03,_06,,,,,,,,,_04,"It's okay, not as dull as I thought. Tackling all kinds of safety issues is like solving puzzles. And I learn tons of real skills, feeling more capable by the day."
818,_01,26,_02,_01,_02,_02,_06,,,,,,,,,_04,"Pretty good. This job's steady and helps people. Daily tasks aren't repetitive, there's challenge and gain, pay's decent too—no complaints."

844,_02,25,_03,_02,_03,_01,_01,_02,_03,,,,,,,_05,"Everything goes well, I think.In terms of safety, there's actually no need to worry too much, and the salary in this aspect is also quite good."
846,_01,45,_04,_01,_03,_04,_04,,,,,,,,,_03,"The core of security work lies in ""protection"" — whether it is safeguarding corporate data, user privacy, fending off cyber attacks, or maintaining business stability. Every successful vulnerability fix, emergency response, or upgrade of security systems allows one to directly witness the outcomes of their work."
848,_02,29,_05,_01,_03,_04,_01,_04,_06,,,,,,,_04,"1. Sense of value: Safeguard safety, resolve risks, and do meaningful work.

2. Rapid growth: Exposure to diverse knowledge and skills, with continuous capability enhancement.

3. Good atmosphere: Cohesive teamwork and recognition and respect from the industry."
849,_02,55,_05,_02,_02,_05,_06,_08,,,,,,,,_03,"The core of ""somewhat satisfied"" lies in ""not to the point of leaving, but not yet with the enthusiasm to fully commit"" — acknowledging both the fundamental value of the security industry and the stability of one's own work, while clearly recognizing the bottlenecks in the current environment (such as slow growth, lack of challenges, and insufficient support)."
850,_02,46,_05,_01,_01,_04,_08,,,,,,,,,_04,"In the digital era, security has gradually evolved from a ""peripheral function"" to a ""core strategy"". The importance of this work is now recognized by both management and business departments, and it is no longer an ""invisible defense line"". This state of being needed and valued has significantly enhanced job satisfaction."
851,_02,44,_04,_01,_04,_07,_08,,,,,,,,,_02,"The career path is vague, and the motivation for promotion is mediocre. The company has no clear promotion criteria for security positions — for example, the capabilities required to move from a specialist to a supervisor, or how long it takes to get a promotion opportunity, are all unclear."

854,_01,44,_04,_02,_03,_05,_06,,,,,,,,,_03,"The workload is not extremely heavy, allowing for a basic balance between work and life. The salary is at a medium level in the industry, sufficient to cover daily expenses. This state of ""not being stressed enough to want to escape, nor being so financially strained that a job change is imperative"" makes people inclined to ""maintain the status quo for now."""
855,_02,51,_05,_02,_07,_05,_03,,,,,,,,,_04,"There is excellent room for development, and it is also very friendly to female practitioners."
856,_01,58,_06,_04,_06,_05,_06,,,,,,,,,_04,"The team atmosphere is relatively harmonious, with no serious workplace conflicts or gender bias — which is particularly important for female practitioners — and work can generally proceed according to procedures."
860,_01,52,_05,_01,_05,_04,_01,_04,,,,,,,,_04,"In recent years, with the improvement of regulations such as the 'Cybersecurity Law' and the 'Data Security Law,' and the public's increased awareness of privacy and risks, security work has gradually shifted from being 'behind-the-scenes support' to becoming 'core and front-line.' Companies are willing to invest more resources in security, and society's perception of security professionals has transitioned from 'tech geeks' to 'guardians of safety.' This increase in recognition further strengthens professional identity."
861,_02,45,_06,_01,_02,_02,_01,_02,_03,_04,_05,,,,,_03,"Because I feel the job is a bit dull and boring, but fortunately, the welfare benefits are quite good. I have to support my family, and a stable job brings me a sense of security"
862,_02,42,_03,_02,_01,_01,_04,,,,,,,,,_04,"My job makes me feel both challenging and interesting, which makes me feel very fulfilled and fulfilled."
863,_02,34,_04,_01,_02,_01,_01,,,,,,,,,_04,"Industry Advantage (Source of High Satisfaction) 
Demand growth: There is a significant shortage of cybersecurity professionals (approximately 3.5 million vacancies worldwide), and the job stability is high. 
Salary competitiveness: According to the ISC² report, the average salary of security professionals is 20% - 30% higher than that of other IT positions. 
Sense of mission: Protecting data/infrastructure from attacks, with a strong sense of social value."
864,_02,31,_04,_03,_02,_03,_02,,,,,,,,,_02,I feel that work has deprived me of my freedom. I have thought about arranging my time more reasonably. I want to be a woman with more control
866,_02,35,_05,_01,_04,_02,_03,,,,,,,,,_05,"The satisfaction and challenges of work In my job, what makes me most fulfilled is achieving goals, no matter how big or small, through my own efforts. Whenever I face difficulties and challenges, I can always find a sense of achievement from them. And this sense of satisfaction makes me look forward to and embrace new work projects and challenges even more."
